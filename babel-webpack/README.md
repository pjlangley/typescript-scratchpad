# TypeScript, Webpack & Babel

This demonstrates running Babel to compile the TS files into JS, using Webpack's
`babel-loader`, and then bundling it for the browser.

The TypeScript compiler task can be run in parallel to catch any type errors.

Browser support based on the `browserslist` contents in `package.json`.
